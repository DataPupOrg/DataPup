## Logging Usage

This project uses [electron-log](https://github.com/megahertz/electron-log) for logging purposes.

The logger is initialized in `src/main/utils/logger.ts`

The logs are written to the following file locations:

- **on Linux** : `~/.config/DataPup/logs/[YYYY-MM-DD].log`
- **on macOS** : `~/Library/Logs/DataPup/[YYYY-MM-DD].log`
- **on Windows** : `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\DataPup\logs\[YYYY-MM-DD].log`

## Style Guide

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add types rather than using `any`
- Document complex logic with comments

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Radix UI components for consistency
- Follow accessibility best practices
